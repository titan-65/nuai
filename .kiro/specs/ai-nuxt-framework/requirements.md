# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AI Nuxt is a comprehensive AI framework built on top of Nuxt.js that brings unified AI capabilities to Vue.js developers. The framework aims to provide a zero-configuration, developer-friendly solution for integrating various AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) into Nuxt applications with features like streaming responses, caching, vector stores, multi-agent systems, and advanced UI components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core AI Provider Integration

**User Story:** As a Vue.js developer, I want to easily integrate multiple AI providers into my Nuxt application, so that I can switch between different AI services without changing my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer installs the AI Nuxt module THEN the system SHALL automatically configure OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama providers
2. WHEN a developer calls `useAI()` composable THEN the system SHALL return a unified interface for chat, completion, and embedding operations
3. WHEN a developer specifies a provider parameter THEN the system SHALL route requests to the specified AI provider
4. IF no provider is specified THEN the system SHALL use the default provider configured in the module options
5. WHEN an AI provider API call fails THEN the system SHALL provide standardized error handling across all providers

### Requirement 2: Streaming and Real-time Communication

**User Story:** As a developer building chat applications, I want to stream AI responses in real-time, so that users can see responses as they are generated rather than waiting for complete responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer uses `useAIStream()` composable THEN the system SHALL provide real-time streaming of AI responses
2. WHEN streaming is enabled THEN the system SHALL use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for unidirectional streaming
3. WHEN bidirectional communication is needed THEN the system SHALL support WebSocket connections
4. WHEN a streaming connection is interrupted THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
5. WHEN streaming data is received THEN the system SHALL update reactive Vue refs in real-time

### Requirement 3: Vue Component Library

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want pre-built Vue components for AI interactions, so that I can quickly build AI-powered user interfaces without creating components from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer imports AI Nuxt components THEN the system SHALL provide `<AIChat>`, `<AIPromptBuilder>`, `<AIModelSelector>`, and `<AIDebugger>` components
2. WHEN using `<AIChat>` component THEN the system SHALL handle message display, input, and loading states automatically
3. WHEN using `<AIPromptBuilder>` THEN the system SHALL provide a visual interface for constructing complex prompts
4. WHEN components are used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and theming across all components
5. WHEN components receive props THEN the system SHALL validate prop types and provide helpful error messages

### Requirement 4: State Management and Persistence

**User Story:** As a developer building conversational AI applications, I want to manage and persist conversation state, so that users can maintain context across sessions and page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer uses AI Nuxt THEN the system SHALL integrate with Pinia for state management
2. WHEN conversations are created THEN the system SHALL automatically persist them to local storage
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL restore previous conversation state
4. WHEN conversation settings are modified THEN the system SHALL update the global AI configuration
5. WHEN multiple conversations exist THEN the system SHALL allow switching between active conversations

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a developer concerned about API costs and performance, I want intelligent caching of AI responses, so that similar requests don't result in redundant API calls and users get faster responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar prompts are submitted THEN the system SHALL use semantic similarity to return cached responses
2. WHEN caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL implement multi-layer caching with configurable TTL
3. WHEN cache similarity threshold is met THEN the system SHALL return cached responses without API calls
4. WHEN responses are cached THEN the system SHALL store embeddings for semantic comparison
5. WHEN cache storage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL use LRU eviction strategy

### Requirement 6: Vector Store and RAG Capabilities

**User Story:** As a developer building knowledge-based AI applications, I want to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), so that AI responses can be enhanced with relevant context from my application's data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are added to the vector store THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings and store them efficiently
2. WHEN a query is made THEN the system SHALL perform similarity search and return relevant documents
3. WHEN RAG is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically inject relevant context into AI prompts
4. WHEN vector operations are performed THEN the system SHALL support multiple vector store backends
5. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL batch operations for efficiency

### Requirement 7: Multi-Agent System

**User Story:** As a developer building complex AI workflows, I want to orchestrate multiple AI agents with different roles and capabilities, so that I can create sophisticated AI-powered applications with specialized agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is defined THEN the system SHALL allow specification of role, capabilities, and tools
2. WHEN agents are executed THEN the system SHALL provide isolated execution contexts
3. WHEN multiple agents collaborate THEN the system SHALL handle inter-agent communication
4. WHEN agents use tools THEN the system SHALL provide a standardized tool interface
5. WHEN agent workflows are complex THEN the system SHALL support sequential and parallel execution

### Requirement 8: Developer Experience and Tooling

**User Story:** As a developer using AI Nuxt, I want comprehensive development tools and debugging capabilities, so that I can efficiently develop, test, and debug AI-powered applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing with AI Nuxt THEN the system SHALL provide DevTools extension for request inspection
2. WHEN debugging AI interactions THEN the system SHALL show token usage, latency, and cost metrics
3. WHEN testing applications THEN the system SHALL provide mocking utilities for AI providers
4. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL support project initialization, provider setup, and deployment commands
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with debugging information

### Requirement 9: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer deploying AI applications to production, I want built-in security features and compliance tools, so that my application is protected against common AI-related security threats and meets regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompts are processed THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent prompt injection attacks
2. WHEN user data is handled THEN the system SHALL automatically scrub personally identifiable information (PII)
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per user and API key
4. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL provide configurable content filtering
5. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL provide GDPR/CCPA compliance tools and audit logging

### Requirement 10: Production Deployment and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer deploying AI applications to production, I want monitoring, observability, and edge deployment capabilities, so that I can ensure reliable performance and optimal user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applications are deployed THEN the system SHALL support edge runtime deployment on Cloudflare, Vercel, and other platforms
2. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL integrate with OpenTelemetry for observability
3. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL track AI-specific metrics like latency, token usage, and costs
4. WHEN errors occur in production THEN the system SHALL provide error tracking and alerting
5. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support multi-tenant deployments with quota management
